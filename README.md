🧮 Simple Calculator — Python

Welcome to the Simple Calculator Project!
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that can perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
It is written in a clean, simple, human-understandable way so anyone can read and learn from it.

✨ What This Calculator Can Do

This calculator helps you do:

Operation	Example
➕ Addition	4 + 2 = 6
➖ Subtraction	9 - 3 = 6
✖️ Multiplication	5 * 2 = 10
➗ Division	10 / 2 = 5
🧮 Modulus (Remainder)	10 % 3 = 1
🧑‍💻 How It Works

1️⃣ The program asks the user to enter the first number
2️⃣ Then asks for the second number
3️⃣ Then asks which operation you want to perform
4️⃣ It then calculates and shows the result in a friendly message

🧠 Behind The Scenes (Logic Used)

Uses input() to take values from user

Uses def function() for calculation

Uses if-elif-else to check which math symbol user typed

Uses print() to show results
